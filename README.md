## Data preprocessing steps:
- [ ] Splitting the data into training, testing and validation sets.
- [ ] Flattening the images and displaying it.
- [ ] Checking the number of instances for each digit.
- [ ] Plotting graphs and charts for easier understanding.<br>
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.It is a dataset of 70,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.In this project we have used it to classify a given image of a handwritten digit drawn on a canvas into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.


## Model Construction:
Deep learning model:
After manually pre-processing the dataset, we come to the part where we use concepts of Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer learning to build and train a model that classifies the handwritten digits.The 10 classes of digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
- [ ] This model used in Astro Numbers has been trained to detect 10 classes of objects: Numbers from 0-9 using deep learning on the CNN model. 
It contains 2 Convolution layers, 1 dense layer with 128 nodes (ReLU), and a softmax layer with 10 output nodes using TensorFlow and its libraries.
- [ ] The first convolutional layer is added with a small filter size (3,3) and a modest number of filters (64) followed by a max pooling layer. 
- [ ] The second convolutional layer is added with a small filter size (3,3) and a modest number of filters (128) followed by a max pooling layer. <br>

</p>
<br>
	
- [ ] The model is compiled using the adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function will be optimized which is suitable for multi-class classification.We are monitoring the classification accuracy metric since we have the same number of examples in each of the 10 classes.
	<br>
- [ ] The final trained model resulted in an accuracy around 99.71% on the dataset with 70,000 images.
	<br>
- [ ] The model can be experimented , the user can provide the digit input to the canvas and the model will detect which number it is. 

## Functionalities
- [ ]   Astro numbers help primary teachers to give the students a unique experience in solving maths problems. 
- [ ]   Works on a canvas providing an easy drawing interface.
- [ ]   The web based application interface of Astro numbers uses a CNN model to classify the answers drawn by students.
- [ ]   Assessment can be done by teachers and the final scores will appear on the screen.

## Instructions to run:
- [ ] ```pip install --upgrade pandas```
- [ ] ```pip install --upgrade matplotlib```
- [ ] ```pip install --upgrade seaborn```
- [ ] ```pip install --upgrade numpy```
- [ ] ```pip install --upgrade tensorflow```
- [ ] ```python -m http.server 8000```

## Project architecture:
Astro-Numbers uses Tensorflow and Keras libraries to build a sequential model with 2 `Conv2D` layers.
We use `batch_normalization` at the end of every layer for higher accuracy. Activation `relu` worked best for the dataset. 
For the output layer, a `dense` layer was used with `softmax` activation.The tabular explanation of the same can be seen below. <br>

## Model loss:
The following is the validation and training loss of the above model. <br>

</p>
<br>
As seen, there is very little noise in our model. This is due the fact that we have used the `adam` optimizer. 
<br>
	
## Model accuracy:
The following is the validation and training accuracy of the above model. <br>

</p><br>
As of a typical Conv2D model, we see that the accuracy keeps improving in performance compared to the baseline.
